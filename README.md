# Wireshark for Software Engineers

## What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is a protocol analyzer used to filter, debug, and dissect netork protocol traffic. Wireshark sees wide use in a hacking context as well as use for logging and debugging message traffic for Software Engineers.

## Why this tutorial?

This tutorial aims to be a start to finish solution for beginners to learn enough Wireshark to be proficient in a traditional Software Engineer role, whether as a test engineer or someone implementing software that uses protocols common to Wireshark debugging.

Many tutorials out there do not contain sample captures. This tutorial aims to give you a chance to explore everything that you learn with sample traffic so you get a fuller experience of probing network traffic similar to what you might learn on the job.

Wireshark documentation is generally informative, however it can be sparse in some particular areas. This tutorial will aim to bridge that gap.

## Focus

This tutorial is oreinted towards Software Engineers and the main traffic analyzed will be in UDP and TCP packets.
