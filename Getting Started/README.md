Looking at Wireshark packets for the first time can be daunting, but getting started with the program isn't hard.


When you boot up Wireshark it will look something like this

## Capturing data

Choose any active interface that you want to capture and double click it. This will likely be Ethernet or WiFi. The lines next to the interfaces will show the activity on that interface.

It should look something like this

You can stop the capture by pressing the red box or restart the capture using the green refresh icon.

Pay attention to this dialog

Save the capture if it is important to you.

## Opening a File

From the splash page, click `File->Open` and select the file from your filesystem.

## Closing a File or Capture

From the capture or display page, click `File->Close`. If you are in the middle of the capture you will have to stop before this becomes available.
